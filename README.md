# Time Tracker Application
This is a **Time Tracker** web application consisting of a **Node.js backend** and a **frontend** that can be used to track time spent on various tasks. The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, and the frontend is a simple web interface with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash                                            Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JostinJarry/time-tracker.git
cd time-tracker

2. Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
2.1. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend folder and install the required Node.js packages.

bash                                            Copy code
cd backend
npm install

This will install the necessary dependencies, including express and any other packages specified in the backend/package.json file.

2.2. Start the Backend Server
To start the Node.js backend server:

bash                                            Copy code
npm start
The backend will now be running and accessible at http://localhost:5000 (default port for Express).

3. Frontend Setup (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
The frontend consists of static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). There is no build process, as it’s a simple static frontend. You can open the frontend/index.html file directly in your browser or use a local server to serve it.

3.1. Open the Frontend in Your Browser
Simply navigate to the frontend directory and open the index.html file:

bash                                            Copy code
cd ../frontend
open index.html  # Use your preferred method to open HTML file

4. Version Control with Git
This project uses Git for version control. Below are some common Git commands used in this project.

4.1. Initial Setup
After cloning the repository, you can configure your Git user information if it's not already set globally:

bash                                        Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

4.2. Commit Changes
Make sure to commit your changes regularly. Here’s a basic workflow:

Stage your changes:

bash                                        Copy code
git add .

Commit your changes:

bash                                        Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"

Push your changes to the GitHub repository:

bash                                        Copy code
git push origin main

4.3. Handling Authentication with GitHub
GitHub no longer allows password-based authentication for Git operations. You must use either Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or SSH keys.

Using Personal Access Tokens (PAT)
Go to GitHub's Personal Access Tokens page and generate a new token with the necessary scopes (usually repo for full repository access).
When prompted for your password during a Git push, use the PAT instead of your GitHub password.
Using SSH Keys (Optional)
If you prefer to authenticate with SSH, follow these steps:
Generate an SSH key using ssh-keygen.

Add the public key to GitHub in Settings > SSH and GPG Keys.

Set the remote URL to use SSH:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:JostinJarry/time-tracker.git
4.4. Creating a New Branch (Feature Branch Workflow)
It's a good practice to work on new features or bug fixes in a separate branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-branch
After making your changes, you can commit and push the branch to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-branch
5. GitHub Repository Setup
This project is hosted on GitHub at the following URL:

https://github.com/JostinJarry/time-tracker

6. Important Files
.gitignore: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules/, .env, .vscode/).
backend/package.json: Lists backend dependencies and scripts.
frontend/: Contains the static frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS).

### Instructions for Copying:

1. Copy everything between the three backticks (` ```markdown ` and ` ``` `).
2. Create a `README.md` file in the **root** of your project (if you haven’t already).
3. Paste the copied content into the `README.md` file.
4. Save the file.

This should work perfectly when rendered on GitHub or any markdown viewer, and the formatting should be preserved.

Let me know if anything needs further adjustment!
